## Datasets

We use [FFHQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset) and 
[ParisStreetView](https://github.com/pathak22/context-encoder#6-paris-street-view-dataset) 
in our experiments. For the irregular masks, we use the test set of 
[NVIDIA Irregular Mask Dataset](https://nv-adlr.github.io/publication/partialconv-inpainting).

Since we don't have the rights to hold any datasets, please download them from original sources.
